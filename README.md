## What to improve

The application could be more visually appealing by giving a nice picture image or background to it. Right now there is no real time service been used but it could have 'Sign Up' feature as well for registering new user. We can have search functionality to filter the employess on dashbpard page as user want to find. Right now the details of employees are hardcorded, actual data can be displayed once we point to real time services. Also on dashboard page the details of employees are given in grid format, there can be an option to let user choose between grid view or list view.
